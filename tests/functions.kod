# A method signature followed by a colon expects a statement block whereas a
# single expression is expected after an equal sign. This latter alternative
# syntax was introduce as it shortens wrapper methods and is closer to the
# mathematical notation as can be seen in the following examples.

# No type inference:
def Int addOne(Int i):
	return i + 1

# With type inference:
def addOne(i):
	return i + 1

# Shorter:
def addOne(i) = i + 1

# Recursive method:
def Int f(Int x) =
	if x == 0: 5
	else:      x + f(0)

# Shorter:
def f(x) = x == 0 ? 5 \
	              : x + f(0)
